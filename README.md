    Github Repository Viewer
</h1>

This is a ReactJS application developed during [Rocketseat Bootcamp](https://rocketseat.com.br/bootcamp) in order to allow users to see the issues of their favorite github repositories using github API. Data is saved in local storage and users are allowed to add or remove as many repositories as they want. The app validates if the repository is valid or duplicated and the issues can be filtered by opened, closed or all.

## :rocket: Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodvasques/github-explorer
```

Open a terminal on the repository folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

To run the application in development mode run:

```bash

```

This application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Follow the link for further information.
